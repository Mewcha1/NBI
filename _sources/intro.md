# NBI project overview

This project aligns with the call for proposal "Addressing Climate Resiliency through Nature Based
Infrastructure" by addressing the impacts of climate change on groundwater resources and promoting
resilience in South Florida. The project aims to utilize an integrated modeling approach to evaluate and
implement nature-based infrastructure features (NBIFs) that mitigate the effects of climate change on
groundwater resources.

The project focuses on addressing the challenges of sea-level rise, changing precipitation patterns, and
rapid socioeconomic development, which pose threats to groundwater and community resilience in South
Florida. By collaborating with stakeholders and leveraging the expertise of the South Florida Water
Management District (SFWMD) and extension specialists, the project intends to assess the effectiveness
of NBIFs in enhancing groundwater recharge and maintaining ecosystem functions.
The proposed integrated modeling approach involves the utilization of the USGS Biscayne and Southern
Everglades Coastal Transport (BISECT) model, which couples surface water-groundwater density
dependent flow, to simulate the water-ecology-human system in South Florida. Through this modeling
framework, the project aims to quantify groundwater availability and usability, spring discharge, and
submarine groundwater discharge under current and future climate scenarios and groundwater
management strategies identified by SFWMD.
